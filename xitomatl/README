Derick Eddington's personal collection of various R6RS source-code
------------------------------------------------------------------

Source-code I have created; others' source-code I use and want organized in my
own way; and a whole namespace to do whatever I want with.

I've claimed `(xitomatl ---)' as my personal top-level namespace.  "Xitomatl",
pronounced something like "zye-toe-ma-tul", is the Aztec Nahuatl language word
for tomato.  I chose an obscure word I like and which I doubt anyone will ever
have a conflict with me over :-)

The Xitomatl collection requires SRFI libraries conforming to SRFI-97.  The SRFI
libraries used by the author can be found at:

  https://code.launchpad.net/~scheme-libraries-team/scheme-libraries/srfi

Currently supported Scheme systems are Ikarus, Larceny, PLT, and Ypsilon.  They
support the *.IMPL.sls convention for implementation-specific libraries.  Some
of the Xitomatl collection requires the latest development versions of the
Scheme systems.

See the test programs in the "tests" folder for examples of how to use the
libraries.

For the latest development version, go to:

Disclaimer:  
-----------
My libraries are a moving target.  I'm continually changing things.  Other
people's libraries I've assimilated should be stable and should need to be
changed only for bug fixes and updates to new versions.  If in the future some
of my libraries stabilize, I'll advertise that and make documentation.
